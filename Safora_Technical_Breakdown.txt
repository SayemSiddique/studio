# Safora: AI Food Insights - Technical Documentation

## 1. General Overview

*   **Project Name:** Safora: AI Food Insights
*   **Purpose:** To provide users with AI-powered analysis of food products, helping them make informed dietary choices based on their personal preferences, allergies, and health goals.
*   **App Overview:** Safora is a Next.js web application designed to function like a mobile app. Users can:
    *   Go through an onboarding process to set up their detailed dietary profile (preferences like halal, vegan, gluten-free; allergies; health conditions; goals).
    *   Simulate scanning food product barcodes (or enter manually) or OCR for ingredients.
    *   Receive AI-driven analysis of the product's compatibility with their profile.
    *   View detailed product information, including ingredients and AI-generated summaries.
    *   Manage their dietary profile.
    *   View scan history and favorite products.
    *   Browse a directory of known products.

## 2. User Journey & Flow

        *   Onboarding (Data Collection): Slide transitions, "Saf" avatar float (`animate-float`).
        *   ShadCN components often have built-in animations (e.g., accordion, dialog, popover).
        *   Loading states indicated by `Loader2` icon and `Progress` bar.

## 4. Backend Architecture

*   **Firebase Services Used (Based on Mocked Functionality & Typical Next.js/Firebase Setup):**
    *   **Firebase Authentication**: Mocked in `AuthContext` (email/password, Google, Facebook, Phone). In a real app, Firebase SDK would be used directly.
    *   **Firestore**: Mocked for profile storage in `ProfileContext` (using `localStorage`). In a real app, Firestore would store user profiles, scan history, favorites, etc.
    *   **Cloud Storage**: Not explicitly used in the prototype code, but would be necessary for user-uploaded images if that feature were added (e.g., OCR from gallery).
    *   **Firebase ML / Vertex AI**: No direct SDK integration for Firebase ML Kit. AI capabilities are implemented via Genkit flows, which could call Vertex AI models.
    *   **App Hosting**: The app is designed to be deployable on Firebase App Hosting.

*   **Data Schema for Firestore (Hypothetical for a Real Backend):**
    *   **`users` collection:**
        *   Document ID: `uid` (from Firebase Auth)
        *   Fields:
            *   `email: string`
            *   `createdAt: timestamp`
            *   `profile: UserProfile object` (containing all fields like `firstName`, `lastName`, `dateOfBirth`, `location`, `selectedDiets`, `ingredientsToAvoid`, `customIngredientsToAvoid`, `knownAllergens`, `customAllergens`, `healthConditions`, `healthGoalsList`, `profileCompletionStatus`)
    *   **`scanHistory` collection:**
        *   Subcollection under each user: `users/{uid}/scanHistory`
        *   Document ID: auto-generated or `barcode_timestamp`
        *   Fields: `ScanResult object` (barcode, name, brand, imageUrl, ingredients, compatibility, reason, summary, alternatives, scannedAt)
    *   **`favorites` collection:**
        *   Subcollection under each user: `users/{uid}/favorites`
        *   Document ID: `barcode`
        *   Fields: `ProductInfo object` (or `ScanResult` if compatibility at time of favoriting is important)
    *   **`products` collection (Global - if maintaining a central product DB):**
        *   Document ID: `barcode`
        *   Fields: `ProductInfo object` (name, brand, imageUrl, ingredients, category, etc.)

*   **API Integrations or Plugins Used:**
    *   **Barcode Scanning/OCR**: Currently simulated. Real implementation might use:
        *   Browser's MediaStream API (`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`) for camera access (already in place).
        *   JavaScript libraries for barcode decoding from video stream (e.g., Scandit WebSDK (paid), QuaggaJS (open-source, less maintained), zxing-js/library).
        *   For OCR: Tesseract.js (client-side) or a cloud OCR API (Google Cloud Vision API via Genkit).
    *   **OpenFoodFacts API**: Mentioned in requirements, but not integrated in the prototype. Would be called to fetch product data by barcode.
    *   **Genkit**: Used for AI flows.
        *   `analyzeFoodCompatibility`: Takes ingredients and user profile, returns compatibility.
        *   `summarizeIngredientInformation`: Takes ingredients, returns summary.
        *   `suggestAlternatives`: Takes product and user profile, returns alternatives.
        These flows internally use a configured LLM (e.g., Gemini via `@genkit-ai/googleai`).

*   **Cloud Functions Logic (Hypothetical):**
    *   `onUserCreate`: Triggered when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. Could create an initial user document in Firestore.
    *   `onScanLogged`: If scan history needs server-side processing (e.g., aggregation, analytics).
    *   HTTP-triggered functions to interact with external APIs securely (e.g., OpenFoodFacts, if API keys are involved).

## 5. AI/ML Integration

*   **Genkit Framework**: The app uses Genkit to define and run AI-powered flows. The `ai` object is initialized in `src/ai/genkit.ts` using `@genkit-ai/googleai` and configured to use a Gemini model.
*   **Core AI Flows (`src/ai/flows/`)**:
    *   **`analyzeFoodCompatibility.ts`**:
        *   Takes a product's ingredients string and a detailed user dietary profile string (generated by `ProfileContext.getProfileForAI`).
        *   Prompts an LLM to analyze compatibility, returning a status (`Safe`, `Contains Allergen`, `Not Recommended`) and a textual reason.
    *   **`summarizeIngredientInformation.ts`**:
        *   Takes product name and ingredients.
        *   Prompts an LLM to generate a nutritional summary and potential health impacts.
    *   **`suggestAlternatives.ts`**:
        *   Takes product name, user's dietary preferences, and allergies.
        *   Prompts an LLM to suggest 3 alternative products.
*   **Model Usage**: The flows call pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini via the Genkit Google AI plugin. No custom model training is part of this prototype.
*   **User-Specific Filtering**: The `analyzeFoodCompatibility` flow is central to this. The `ProfileContext.getProfileForAI()` method compiles the user's detailed dietary settings (diets, avoidances, allergens, conditions, goals) into a comprehensive string. This string is then passed to the AI prompt, instructing the LLM to consider these specific restrictions when analyzing the food product's ingredients.

        *   `utils.ts` (e.g., `cn` utility).
*   **`tailwind.config.ts`**: Tailwind CSS configuration.
*   **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration.

*   **Naming Conventions**:
    *   Components: PascalCase (e.g., `ProductCard.tsx`).
    *   Pages/Layouts: `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`.
    *   CSS Modules: `ComponentName.module.css`.
    *   Hooks: `useHookName.ts`.
*   **Organization Logic**: Grouped by feature (e.g., `auth`, `product`) or type (e.g., `core`, `ui`) within `components`. Routes are organized using Next.js App Router conventions. Contexts, hooks, and lib utilities are in their respective top-level `src` folders.
*   **State Management**:
    *   Primarily React Context API (`AuthContext` for user authentication state, `ProfileContext` for user dietary profile).
    *   Local component state (`useState`, `useReducer`) for UI-specific states.
    *   `react-hook-form` for form state.

## 8. User Data & Privacy

*   **User Data Storage & Management:**
    *   **Authentication Data**: Managed by `AuthContext`. In the prototype, this is mocked with `localStorage` for the user object. A real Firebase implementation would use Firebase Authentication services.
    *   **Profile Data (`UserProfile`)**: Managed by `ProfileContext`. In the prototype, this is stored in `localStorage`. A real Firebase implementation would store this in Firestore, linked to the user's UID.
    *   **Dietary Preferences, Allergies, Goals**: Stored as part of the `UserProfile` object.
    *   **Scan History & Favorites**: Currently mocked with some static data and `localStorage`. In a real app, this would be stored in Firestore per user.
*   **Permissions Requested:**
    *   **Camera**: For the `/scan` page, `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` is used, which prompts the user for camera permission.
    *   **Geolocation**: For the onboarding location step, `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` prompts for location permission.
    *   **Internet**: Implicitly required for a web application.
    *   **Storage**: Not explicitly requested, but `localStorage` is used by the browser.
*   **Security Rules (Hypothetical for Firestore):**
    *   **User Profiles (`users/{userId}`):**
        *   Allow read, write: if `request.auth.uid == userId` (Users can only access/modify their own profile).
    *   **Scan History (`users/{userId}/scanHistory/{scanId}`):**
        *   Allow read, write, delete: if `request.auth.uid == userId`.
    *   **Favorites (`users/{userId}/favorites/{productId}`):**
        *   Allow read, write, delete: if `request.auth.uid == userId`.
    *   **Products (`products/{productId}` - if global):**
        *   Allow read: if `request.auth != null` (Authenticated users can read).
        *   Write: Restricted to admin/service roles.

## 9. Deployment & Production Readiness

*   **Steps to Prepare for Google Play Store (if wrapping in a PWA/WebView solution like Capacitor/TWA):**
    *   **a. Required Configurations:**
        *   **Web App Manifest (`manifest.json` or `manifest.webmanifest`):** Define app name, short name, icons, start URL, display mode (e.g., `standalone`), theme color, background color. Next.js can generate this.
        *   **Service Worker**: For PWA capabilities (offline support, push notifications).
        *   **App Icons**: Various sizes for different platforms/resolutions.
        *   **Splash Screen Config**: Defined in the manifest and potentially handled by the PWA wrapper.
    *   **b. Debug vs Release Build Settings:**
        *   Next.js production build: `npm run build`.
        *   Environment variables for production (API keys, Firebase config for production project).
        *   Code minification, tree-shaking (handled by Next.js build).
    *   **c. SHA Key Setup for Firebase Services:**
        *   If using Firebase Android SDK directly (for native features within a wrapper), register SHA-1 and SHA-256 fingerprints of your release signing key in the Firebase console for your Android app. This is crucial for Google Sign-In, Phone Auth, etc.
    *   **d. Google Play Store Assets and Listing Prep:**
        *   High-resolution app icon.
        *   Feature graphic.
        *   Screenshots (phone, tablet).
        *   Promo video (optional).
        *   App title, short description, full description.
        *   Privacy policy URL.
        *   Categorization, content rating.
*   **Testing Considerations:**
    *   **Manual Test Flows**: Thoroughly test all user journeys (onboarding, auth, scanning, profile management, history, favorites, product directory).
    *   **Emulator/Device Testing**: Test on various Android/iOS devices and screen sizes (if using a PWA wrapper). For a web app, test across different browsers and viewports.
    *   **Firebase Test Lab**: Can be used for automated testing on a wide range of virtual and physical devices if the app is packaged as an Android APK.
    *   **Responsiveness Testing**: Ensure UI adapts well to different screen sizes.
    *   **Accessibility Testing**: Check for ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, color contrast.

## 10. Recommendations for Completion

*   **Incomplete or Placeholder Areas:**
    *   **Real Barcode/OCR Scanning**: The current scanning is simulated. Integrate actual libraries (e.g., Scandit, QuaggaJS, Tesseract.js, or cloud Vision API via Genkit).
    *   **OpenFoodFacts Integration**: Implement API calls to fetch real product data.
    *   **Real Firebase Backend**: Replace `localStorage` and mocked contexts with actual Firebase Auth and Firestore integration.
    *   **Location Auto-Detection**: Currently only gets coordinates. Integrate a reverse geocoding API (e.g., Google Geocoding API, Nominatim) to convert coordinates to region/country/city for the onboarding.
    *   **Custom Input for "Add Custom" Chips**: In onboarding (Screen 5 - Ingredients to Avoid), the "Add Custom" chip is visual. It should likely open a modal or an inline input field to add truly custom items.
    *   **Error Handling & Edge Cases**: Enhance error handling for API calls, AI flow failures, and user input.
    *   **Loading States**: While some are present, ensure all asynchronous operations have clear loading indicators.
*   **Suggestions for Codebase Structure, Performance, UX:**
    *   **State Management**: For a larger application, consider more robust global state management if Context API becomes cumbersome (though for this prototype, it's likely fine).
    *   **Component Reusability**:
        *   The custom dropdowns in onboarding (Location) could be extracted into a reusable component if similar functionality is needed elsewhere.
        *   The `MultiSelectDropdown` in onboarding could be moved to `components/ui` if used in other forms.
    *   **Performance Optimization**:
        *   Code splitting (handled well by Next.js).
        *   Image optimization (using `next/image` is good, ensure proper `sizes` and `priority` props).
        *   Memoization (`React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`) for expensive computations or to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
        *   Debouncing/throttling for search inputs if they trigger API calls.
    *   **UX Enhancements**:
        *   **Onboarding Date Picker**: The current ShadCN `Calendar` in a `Popover` is good. Ensure it's intuitive.
        *   **Form Validation**: Add more inline validation in onboarding steps for a better UX, rather than waiting for a "Next" click if critical info is missing.
        *   **Accessibility (A11y)**: Continuously review and improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management, color contrast).
        *   **Empty States**: Ensure all lists (history, favorites, products) have well-designed empty states.
*   **Firebase Service Quota or Billing Considerations:**
    *   **Firestore**: Reads/writes/deletes are billed. Efficient queries and data structures are important. Minimize unnecessary document reads.
    *   **Firebase Authentication**: Generous free tier, but costs can apply for high MAU or advanced features like SMS for phone auth.
    *   **Cloud Functions / Genkit Flows (Vertex AI)**:
        *   Function invocations, compute time, and network egress are billed.
        *   LLM API calls (e.g., to Gemini via Vertex AI) have their own pricing based on input/output tokens. Monitor usage.
    *   **Cloud Storage**: Storage and data transfer costs if used.
    *   **App Hosting**: Costs based on instances, CPU, memory, bandwidth. Start with the free tier and monitor usage.
    *   Set up budget alerts in Google Cloud Platform / Firebase.
